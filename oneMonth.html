                    It was that day I realised,
                    A hot, handsome, cute and sweet guy came in my life. 
                    I was scared to tell him how I felt,
                    But he surely made me lost in his voice. 
                    oh god! I wanna tell you how special you are to me,
                    I want you to spend your each Valentine with me. 
                    You are that person whom I never wanna make upset,
                    You are that person with whom I am obsessed!!   

                    Happy one month anniversary oppa 💘💗🔥🔥

                        When I met you I don't know why all my pains vanished.
                        When I talk to you I just wanna listen to you speak,
                        and want you to never leave.
                        You make me lost in your eyes,
                        You make me loose my mind.
                        It is difficult to express my love for you in words,
                        Just understand that you are that piece of art which can't be measured in terms of money.
                        You are so special to me,
                        I want to give you this whole world and that's my promise.
                        You have made me obsessed with you
                        Every day my heart, my brain and I scream that I love you.
                        and never want to let go of you.
                        Now it has been carved in my heart's core
                        That every day I love you more and more!!!😍😍🥰🥰😘😘😊😊❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥💞💗🌹🌹

                        You have eyes as beautiful as diamond
                        You have a smile as beautiful as a small child
                        You have an aura which is very comforting
                        You ask me why I fell for you
                        Boy it was for a million and trillion reasons which I myself don't know
                        I don't know why but everything related to u is special
                        I have fallen deeply for you 
                        How to explain that I love you
                        You are that motivation which can pull me out of depression
                        Oh boy my heart is screaming right now so loudly that I can hear it
                        These three words r so small to express what I feel 
                        Oppa I have fallen for u head over heels❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥💞💗🌹🌹
