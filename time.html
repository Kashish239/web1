        🥰 You are that note which completed my music 
        you are that missing value which I was finding in maths
        You are that piece of rock which the world calls diamond
        You are that star in the sky which shines the most
        Your eyes are the gateway to that world which a human can only imagine  
        Your smile is that drug which can make a depressed mind happy
        You are  that first rain which I have been waiting after the intense heat.
        I love how hard you work for your goal
        I love that you are so loyal
        I love the comfortable and safe feeling I feel around you
        This poem depicts a few of your qualities that u own
        You have an unknown potential which you don't know 
        You can do anything cuz that's what I feel
        Don't ask why I wrote all this 
        Its just the fact that I miss you right now deeply  💞💞

    smile is mine 
    but reason is you

    thoughts are mine
    but it is all about you

    body is mine 
    but energy is you 

    heart is mine
    but it beats for you

    eyes are mine 
    but it can only see you

    Depression is mine 
    but the relief is you

    you are inseparable from me and that is why I love you!!!!!🍫🍫

    💟Jab bhi aankh band karti hoon tera chehra dikhai deta hai
    Dil ki har dhadkan najane kyun bas tera naam chilla jaati hai
    Bhaad mein jaaye duniya ke 7 ajoobe
    Mere dil mein tu ek lauta sabse sundar ajooba hai 💓
